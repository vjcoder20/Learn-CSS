        <h2><li style ="font-weight: bold;">Easy to use</li></h2>
        <p>
            React is easy to read and that is one of the most important reasons to choose this library. Since it doesnâ€™t take much time to learn these technologies, you can quickly start building things with them.
        </p>

<p>If technology is hard to learn, you will probably find it difficult to get started. That, as it happens, is human nature. We avoid things that are hard to learn.</p>

<p>React is easy to read not only because there are a lot of easy-to-understand lessons available online but especially because it is a very simple library. Unlike Angular, it is not a complex tool. The learning process becomes easier if you have good JavaScript skills.</p>

<h2><li style="font-weight: bold;">Rich user Interfaces</li></h2>
<p>
    React allows you to create rich user interfaces easily. The quality of the user interface is important because a poorly designed interface is often not easy to use and users will not like the badly designed UI.
</p>
<p>
    If your web app has cool, high-quality UI, your users will love to use your app. So building high-quality communication infrastructure is essential to the success of a business.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, you can create cool connections with other technologies as well, but React allows you to easily do it using advertising materials.
</p>

<h2><li style="font-weight: bold;">Faster development</li></h2>
<p>
    You can enhance your product by using recyclable materials and development tools. Engineer production is important because if you can do things quickly, you can earn a lot of money in less time, which is a common goal for companies and startups.
</p>
<p>
    If you take too long to build something simple, you will lose money. Conversely, if you can deliver products faster, you can earn money faster and your customers will be happier.
</p>
<p>
    There are many development tools available in React that speed up your work. For example, there is a browser extension called React Developer Tools, which can make your coding process much easier.
</p>
<div class = "marge"></div>
<h2><li style="font-weight: bold;">Trusted by great companies</li></h2>
<p>
    React is used by large companies and startups like Facebook, Dropbox, Khan Academy, CodeAcademy, Netflix, Airbnb, PayPal, Walmart, Tesla Motors, IMDb, and so on. There are many popular apps that use React.
</p>
<p>
    Why are so many companies and startups using this technology? The answer is that it is undoubtedly the most advanced development tool in the past.
</p>
<p>
    If you think that the most successful companies like Facebook and PayPal use React, that should mean that the library is really useful.
</p>
<div class = "marge"></div>
<h2><li style="font-weight: bold;">Strong community support</li></h2>
<p>
    One of the main reasons why you should choose React with advance development is that it has strong community support. A large community of developers is making React better as an open source library and codes from around the world help people learn technology in a variety of ways.
